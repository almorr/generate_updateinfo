UPDATEINFO.XML GENERATION
=========================

This utility eats an errata.latest.xml from the CEFS project [http://cefs.steve-meier.de]
and converts it in to a useable updateinfo.xml that you can inject in to your CentOS 
repositories. It is purpose built for a specific use case, but it can be modified to 
suit your particular needs.


Usage
-----
You must set the configuration variables in the header of the script first.
Once you've done this, simply run:

```bash
generate_updateinfo.py /path/to/errata.latest.xml
```

It will write out a number of updateinfo.xml files in the 
BUILD_PREFIX/updateinfo-RELEASES/ directory.

You can now take the appropriate updateinfo.xml file and inject it in your
repository using the /usr/bin/modifyrepo command.

*NOTE* that there is an 'other' release in the RELEASES variable. That is the directory where 
all packages that don't match a particular release number will be stored. You can use this for
debugging or other tracking purposes. You don't need to inject this in to any of your repos.

Example
-------
The following example illustrates how you would go about using this for a CentOS 6 repo.
The assumption is that you've set the BUILD_PREFIX=/security and that your CentOS-6-Updates
directory lives under /repositories/

```bash
wget -q -N -P/tmp http://cefs.steve-meier.de/errata.latest.xml.bz2

(cd /tmp/ && sha1sum -c <(wget -qO- http://cefs.steve-meier.de/errata.latest.sha1|grep bz2) )

generate_updateinfo.py <(bzip2 -dc /tmp/errata.latest.xml.bz2)

/usr/bin/modifyrepo /tmp/updateinfo-6/updateinfo.xml /repositories/CentOS-6-Updates/repodata
```

Now that your repos have the data they need you can install the yum-plugin-security package
and make use of it like so

```bash
yum install yum-plugin-security

yum security-list
